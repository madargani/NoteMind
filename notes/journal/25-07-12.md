I kinda figured out poetry. I can now run the app like it's an actual cli app like `notemind init`.

I also tried starting on `init` today. I think I've realized I haven't done enough research yet. I need to understand what files will go in `.notemind` and how they will be used. I will take notes on that and finish `init` once I'm done.

I think I might've messed up on the past dates for the journal. I'm kinda confused. I wrote the above part yesterday but today is the twelfth. Twelfth doesn't look like a real word... Not much work done today, I was busy with the garage sale. I made some ui mock ups for `notemind status` and did more research. I think I'm going to have two databases, an sqlite database for keeping track of file status, and a chroma vector database for storing file embeddings. I'll write that on the plan doc tmrw.

## To do
- update `plan.md` about sqlite and chroma database
