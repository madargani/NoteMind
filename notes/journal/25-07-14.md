# 25-07-14

Working on `commit` and `status`. They have similar parts so I want to see how I can write them efficiently

Commit:
1. Get status from db
2. Get status from fs
3. Update statuses in db
4. Generate embeddings for updated / new files
5. Update statuses that aren't up to date

Status:
1. Get status from db
2. Get status from fs
3. Update statuses in db
4. Print files that aren't up to date
