Recently I've seen a lot of people around my age doing really well in life and their career so I got inspired. Maybe bitter, jealous, lazy... but still inspired. I want to start doing more projects so I started on this last night. The working name is notemind. I'm ashamed to say the name is AI generated. I'll change the name when I come across something better. The app is basically tool for converting notes into an easily searchable knowledge base using RAG. I think it could be really useful. If not then it's still a good project. I'm learning about RAG, python poetry, and I'm going to complete another project. That's reward enough for me.

Last night I tried planning this whole project. I want to make sure this goes as smooth as possible so that I actually finish this. One thing I've found AI is really good for is project brainstorming. 

My current planning process includes these key elements:
- Technologies and tools
- Features and entities
- Project architecture
- Example use scenario
- Schedule
Inspired by this article: <https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-plan-a-coding-project>

If I was working with a team schedule would be more important.

I'm currently aiming for a packaged python cli app, but I'm learning a lot about streamlit from my internship at WEX. It shouldn't be too hard to convert this to a web app after if I want to.

Next steps:
- Text intake and chunking
- Generating embeddings and metadata
- Chat bot
