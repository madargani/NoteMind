# 🧪 Chemical Equilibrium Notes

## ⚖️ What is Chemical Equilibrium?

Chemical equilibrium occurs in a **reversible reaction** when the **rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction**, and the concentrations of reactants and products remain **constant over time**.

### General Form:
```
aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD
```

At equilibrium:
- The system is **dynamic** (reactions continue, but with no net change).
- Concentrations are **not necessarily equal**, just **unchanging**.

## 📏 Equilibrium Constant (K)

The equilibrium constant expression for the reaction above is:

```
K = [C]^c [D]^d / [A]^a [B]^b
```

- **K > 1** → Products favored at equilibrium  
- **K < 1** → Reactants favored  
- **K = 1** → Balanced mixture of products and reactants

> Only **aqueous and gaseous species** appear in the expression. Solids and liquids are omitted.

## 🔁 Reaction Quotient (Q)

Like K, but for **any moment in time**:
```
Q = [C]^c [D]^d / [A]^a [B]^b
```

Compare Q to K:
- **Q < K**: Shift right (toward products)
- **Q > K**: Shift left (toward reactants)
- **Q = K**: System is at equilibrium

## 🔄 Le Châtelier’s Principle

If a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it will **shift** to minimize the disturbance.

| Change                      | Shift                  |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| ↑ Reactant concentration   | Right (more products)  |
| ↑ Product concentration    | Left (more reactants)  |
| ↑ Pressure (gases only)    | Toward fewer moles     |
| ↑ Temperature (endothermic)| Right                  |
| ↑ Temperature (exothermic) | Left                   |
| Adding catalyst            | No shift (reaches equilibrium faster) |

## 🌡️ Temperature & K

- **Exothermic**: ↑T → ↓K  
- **Endothermic**: ↑T → ↑K

K changes **only with temperature** — not with concentration, pressure, or catalysts.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Equilibrium is **dynamic**, not static.
- K helps predict the **extent** of a reaction.
- Le Châtelier’s Principle helps understand **shifts** in equilibrium.
- **ICE tables** (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) are useful for solving equilibrium problems.
