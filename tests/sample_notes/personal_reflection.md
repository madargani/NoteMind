# Personal Reflection - July 1, 2025

I’ve been thinking a lot about digital clutter.  
All these notes, bookmarks, saved articles — they’re useless if I can’t find them later.  
I want to build a system that lets me *ask questions* and get pointed to relevant ideas across my notes.  
Maybe something like a personal assistant that remembers everything I’ve read.

“Search is the mind’s way of revisiting thought.”  
– Me, just now.
